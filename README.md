# HR Database & Webapp Source
A temporal schema database designed to allow retroactive record changes while keeping audit logs of all changes. CSS files used from Microsoft's Contosa .NET/C# MVVC example, but these can be recreated easily.
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my familiarity with SQL based databases, full stack development, and showcase coding styles.
